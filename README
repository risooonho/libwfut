 libwfut
=========

libwfut is a C++ implementation of the client side of WFUT (forge/tools/WFUT).
The aim of this library is to provide update capabilities for C++ based
clients. As an example of library usage, a command line update tool is also
provided.

This library used tinyxml (http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/) to parse the
XML documents and libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se/) to download files.
Tinyxml is embedded in the library, with the source being kept in the tinyxml
subdir. The only difference between this version and the original version is
the addition of the WFUT namespace to avoid potential conflicts with other
embedded tinyxml versions.

libwfut is split up into a number of classes. There are a number of XML reading
and writing classes (FileParser, FileWriter and ChannelParser). These perform
the basic I/O operations on the file listings. The IO class handles all of the
file downloading. This wraps round the curl library. The final main class is
the WFUTClient class which wraps up the other classes and manages determining
what files to update.

libwfut allows two modes of file download. The first mode is a blocking
download. A call to WFUTClient::downloadFile with a source URL and destination
filename.This function will return when the download completes successfully, or
fails for some reason.

The second mode places multiple files in a download queue. The queue is
processed a bit at a time  by calling the poll function. Signals are fired when
a download completes successfully or fails for some reason.
