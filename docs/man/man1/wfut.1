wfut is a command-line update tool intended for use with WorldForge systems. It provides the client side update functionality. Server-side functionality is still at present only available in the Java version of WFUT.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-u " channel_name" "\fR,\fP \-\-update=" channel_name
Update the channel
.I channel_name.
This can be a period, ., if the current directory (or prefix) is the full path to a channel.

.TP
.BI \-p " local_root" "\fR,\fP \-\-prefix=" local_root
Use the directory
.I local_root
instead of the current working directory to search for local updates.

.TP
.BI \-s " system_root" "\fR,\fP \-\-system=" system_root
Look in
.I system_root
for read-only / package installed channel data.

.TP
.BI \-S " server_root" "\fR,\fP \-\-server=" server_root
Use
.I server_root
as the base URL on the server in which channels are kept.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following command will update the channel
.I sear\-media.
This will look for a directory called sear\-media in $HOME/.wfut/,
or create one if necessary and download updates into there.
It will also look in /usr/share/wfut/sear\-media for existing files.

wfut \-s /usr/share/wfut/ \-p $HOME/.wfut/ \-u sear\-media

.SH NOTES
wfut uses curl internally.
